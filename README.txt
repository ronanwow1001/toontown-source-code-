hey, toontown fans, it is ronan caleb here and I am opening the game toontown 
tips: I have to test the game first before anything, I will tell you when you can play.
first: you have to install hamachi but... thats only if you know how to connect with the server using remote connections
second: run Launcher.exe at the same time as you run start_all
third: enjoy!
but remember that i will tell you when you can play ,but... until then stay tooned!
